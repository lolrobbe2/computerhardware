# introduction 

`RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)`: is a storage technology that combines multiple physical hard drives into a single logical unit to improve `performance`, `data reliability`, or `both`. By distributing or duplicating data across disks using different RAID levels, RAID helps protect against hardware failure and can increase read/write speeds depending on the configuration.
