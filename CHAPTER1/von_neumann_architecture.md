# introduction
> [!NOTE]
> The Von Neumann architecture uses a single memory for both data and instructions.  
> A processor repeatedly fetches an instruction, decodes it, and executes it — the basis of most modern computers.
> This is also called the Fetch, Decode, Execute cycle

## PDP-8 Innovation – Single Bus (Second Generation)

> [!NOTE]
> The PDP‑8’s key innovation was its **single‑bus architecture**, which simplified the design and drastically reduced hardware cost.  
> This made the machine smaller, cheaper, and accessible — helping establish the PC era.
