# questions:

## (1) What are the advantages of using a compiler?
- `Faster` execution at `runtime` (code is translated once to machine code)
- Better optimization opportunities
- No need for source code at runtime

## (2) What are the disadvantages of using a compiler?
- Longer build/compile time
- Platform dependent binaries
- Less flexible for rapid prototyping
- Full recompilation needed after changes

## (3) What are the advantages of using an interpreter?
- `Immediate` execution (no separate compile step)
- `Easier debugging` (line-by-line execution, warning for JIT )
- Highly `portable` across platforms (.NET)
- `Faster for prototyping` and scripting (code can be reloaded at runtime, also called hot reloading)

## (4) What are the disadvantages of using an interpreter?
- `Slower` runtime performance
- Requires source code at runtime
- Limited optimization compared to compilers
